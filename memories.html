<p><strong>Tales about the milkman.</strong></p>
<p>The first concerns one night when he&#39d gone out for a drink with his horse and cart. In those days, the pubs all closed at 10:30 pm [at least in theory &#45 practice was another matter]. Anyway, milkie had perhaps the odd one more than was good for him and was stopped by the village bobby. The bobby told him he was to be charged with being drunk in charge of the horse. Milkie replied with &#39 Don&#39t be an idiot lad. The horse is in charge of me &#45 and he&#39s sober &#39</p>


<p>On another occasion, milkie decided to treat his wife by taking her to Blackpool. Now Blackpool is a fair way on a horse and cart, so they set off early. Unfortunately, it took quite a while to get past Rawtenstall. And the horse stopped at every pub for the first couple of miles. I hear tell it was a while before he heard the last of that one!</p>


 <p><strong>Tales about Jimmy Stott.</strong></p>

<p>Jimmy was a close friend of dad&#39s. He lived with his mother at number 1 Mansion House Buildings. This was the opposite end of the terrace that we lived on. As was normal then with male friends of parents, we all called him uncle. Jimmy was enormous. Some said he weighed 40 stones, some said 50 stones. Whatever the accurate figure, it was a lot more than the standard public scales would go to. Their limit was 20 stones. I do know that me and my sister Betty could both comfortably fit in one of his trouser legs, because we tried it.</p>
<p>One of his practices was that when he sat down to eat, he positioned his chair so that his stomach was six inches from the table (15 cm for the younger reader). When his stomach touched the table, he stopped. I think this was Jim&#39s idea of portion control.</p>
<p>I think dad&#39s favourite Jimmy incident related to a bet in the Printer&#39s Arms. The pub landlord was a similar size to Jimmy. Two of the passing trade had got into an argument as to which was the heavier, Jimmy or the landlord. They had drunk to the point of daftness where a substantial bet resulted. To settle the issue, both needed to be weighed, and as it happened, the landlord possessed scales of sufficient capacity for the job. Jimmy refused to be weighed. What he did was discus the matter with each of the two protagonists separately. He convinced each one that he, Jimmy, knew both weights. He further convinced the one that he was talking to that he had the wrong side of the bet. Because of the amount of the bet, each of them paid Jimmy a lesser amount on condition that he continued to refuse to be weighed. Dad and Jimmy had an evening&#39s free drinking out of that affair.</p>
<p>Jimmy had a problem with buses. The normal gap between two rows of seats was too small for him to get in. If he sat on the bench seat at the rear of the bus downstairs, then people boarding would have had a struggle to get past. I think the conductor would have told him to move, or get off the bus. Then, buses loaded from the back, the fare was collected by a conductor, and the conductor&#39s word was law. That only left one option. The stairs went up the back of the bus, and the rear seat upstairs was extended an extra seat&#39s width to the stairwell. The extended part faced the aisle, so there was nothing in front of it. This was the only seat that could accommodate Jimmy. There was one small problem. He had to climb the stairs. Not only was he not built for stairs, but the stairs were not built for him. They were very narrow, so it was quite a squeeze. Mostly, Jimmy did not catch buses.</p>

 <p><strong>Rose hips</strong></p>
<p>DelRosa made rose&#45hip syrup, which I&39m told is very rich in vitamin C. My parents had some sort of agency for DelRosa. In the autumn, we used to go collecting. There were rose trees growing wild all up the valley (hence Rossendale &#45 valley of the rose). Mum and dad got 6d a pound, but only for red ones. They used to pay us three ha&#39pence a pound for what we collected individually. I sub-contracted some of the local children to collect at 1d a pound. 
To put this in perspective, my pocket money was 6d (2.5 p in today&#39s money), which at that time would buy 4 oz of sweets (114 g for those of the metric persuasion).
While the rose-hips were in season, I did very nicely.</p>

 <p><strong>Blackberries</strong></p>
<p>About the same time of year, we went blackberry picking as a family. I can&#39t say how many we picked, but mostly they were turned into bramble jelly, the rest went into jam or pies. Mum used to carefully save all jam jars. She must have stockpiled the sugar ration as well, because we would have needed a couple of stones of sugar for all the jelly she made. The jam was set aside for our own use. The bramble jelly was released in a measured stream to a stall on Rawtenstall market, where it was sold on a commission basis. I seem to remember that it went for 2 shillings a jar, which seemed a lot, since jam was less than half that. We were not allowed any, except for the part jar at the end of a batch. That lasted about as long as it took to spread the bread!</p>
