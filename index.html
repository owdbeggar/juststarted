    <p><em>This is a new paragraph <strong>Halleluya</strong></em></p>
    <p>After eight years as an industrial engineer, I was unexpectedly offered a job effectively as a trainee analyst programmer 
       (there was no title, but that's no matter, it a was 1976. After a few moves, I finished up as manager of a computer department, a position I held for 17 years. 
       Then they moved the company to China. I was left stranded as an unemployed man in his fifties with expertise on out of date technology. 
       I spent most of the rest om my working life in IT support. I am now retired.</p>
